## Add a new tool

First, please open a new issue for a tool that you want to add.

Next, please read the previous pull requests which added a new tool and
read ["How to write a new runner?"](docs/how-to-write-a-new-runner.md) before you start coding.

When you understand them, let's write your code and open a new pull request!

## Fix a bug

Otherwise, that is if the bug is clear and needs no discussion, please open a new pull request directly.
